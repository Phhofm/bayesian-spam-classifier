# BayesianSpamFilter

This was a short exercise in the 'Practical Artificial Intelligence' lecture at university of zuerich.
The task was to implement a bayesian classifier, given the framework.
I went with the Binarized Multinomial Naive Bayes, since the binarized multinomial showed good results according to the paper.
For more information, have a look into the src/BayesianClassifier.java file.

I plan to do a reworked version of this in the future, since this could be optimized.
